# Maps
The maps and active rotation used on the Minehut [Warzone](https://warz.one) server.

## Updating the Repo
When adding or modifing any map in this repo, please note some of the requirements we have for our maps.

**World Requirements:**
- Make sure the world of the map is compatible with the latest Minecraft version the plugin supports.
- The map must be fully pruned (The only chunks saved should be the map itself, you can use a program such as [this](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector) one).
- You must only include the required world files (`level.dat`, `map.json`, and `region/*`).

**Additional Requirements:**
- You must include a valid `map.json` file (This file is used to define locations and kits for TGM).
- Ensure the map you are adding has a **commercial license**, meaning we have full permission to add the map and use it on our server.
- In the JSON, you must include **all** builders that have helped build the map a significant amount.
	- Make sure the usernames you include in the ``authors`` section of the JSON has the builder's current username.

## Tips
If you need any additional support with writing a map.json or anything else, you can try checking out our [docs](https://docs.warz.one) or by contacting a *Map Developer* on our Discord server located [here](https://warz.one/discord).
